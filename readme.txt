== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I view or submit bugs or feature requests? =

You may use [the Support tab](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/interspire-bigcommerce "Open the Support tab").

= What are the system requirements =

* Requires PHP version 5. If your web host does not support PHP5, please contact your host and see if they can upgrade your PHP version.
* Activate `curl` if your web host doesn't already have it running. Generally this can be done at no cost.

= When should I rebuild my products/cache? =

* Rebuild your products list whenever you upgrade the Plugin, or whenever you add new products or change existing product names, links, or images within your store.

= How can I change the product listings by category HTML? =

* In version 1.5 we added a filter to permit template customization using external code. This allows you to customize the product rows HTML while continuing to keep the Plugin up to date.
